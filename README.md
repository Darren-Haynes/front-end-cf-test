### Slider

I did not builder the slider from scratch for the index.html page. I modified a very cool slider by Avi Kohn: http://codepen.io/AMKohn/pen/EKJHf
NOTE: I still need to fix the overlay on the slider (with the text and red button) - images 2-6 on the slider need their own overlay. Currently only the into slider image has the overlay.

### Menu text links
I give a shout out to the awesome css-tricks.com
I utilized code found there to make the menu links expand on hover.

```css
.grow { transition: all .2s ease-in-out; }
.grow:hover { transform: scale(1.1); }
```
